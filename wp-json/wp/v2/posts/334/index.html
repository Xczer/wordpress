A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth.<\/p>\n<p>Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Definition<\/li>\n<li>Geology\n<ol>\n<li>Volcanoes<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mountain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Block mountains<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<li>Climate<\/li>\n<li>Mountains and humans\n<ol>\n<li>Mountain societies and economies<\/li>\n<li>Mountaneering<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Definition<\/h2>\n<p>There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow&#8217;s Dictionary of Physical Geography[2] states &#8220;Some authorities regard eminences above 600 metres (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Geology<\/h2>\n<p>There are three main types of mountains: <strong>volcanic, fold, and block<\/strong>. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth&#8217;s crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features.<\/p>\n<p>The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. <del>Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs<\/del>, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.<\/p>\n<h3>Volcanoes<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-338\" src=\"http:\/\/estudiopatagon.com\/themes\/wordpress\/recov3\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/provoke-art-3563931_1280-1024x723.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"507\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Volcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mountain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When the magma reaches the surface<\/a>, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of volcanoes include <em>Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines<\/em>. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the US.<\/p>\n<h3>Fold mountains<\/h3>\n<p>Fold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened.<\/p>\n\n<p>Since the less dense continental crust &#8220;floats&#8221; on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle.<\/p>\n<p><code>Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas.<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.
