A mockup is a prototype if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.<\/p>\n<p>Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. Mock-ups address the idea captured in a popular engineering one-liner: You can fix it now on the drafting board with an eraser or you can fix it later on the construction site with a sledge hammer.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Applications<\/li>\n<li>Consumer goods<\/li>\n<li>Furniture and cabinetry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Applications<\/h2>\n<p><em>Mockups are used as design tools virtually everywhere a new product is designed.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Mockups are used in the automotive <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mockup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">device industry<\/a> as part of the product development process, where dimensions, overall impression, and shapes are tested in a wind tunnel experiment. They can also be used to test consumer reaction.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumer goods<\/h2>\n<p>Mockups are used in the consumer goods industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, <strong>human factors<\/strong>, overall impression, and commercial art are tested in marketing research.<\/p>\n<h2>Furniture and cabinetry<\/h2>\n<p>Mockups are commonly required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry.<\/p>\n<p>The intention is often to produce a full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine the proportions of the piece, relating to various dimensions of the piece itself, or to fit the piece into a specific space or room.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The ability to see how the design of the piece relates to the rest of the space is also an important factor in determining size and design.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When designing a functional piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, mockups can be used to test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use.<\/p>\n<p>Mockups can also be used to test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. Mockups used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.<\/p>\n<h2>Architecture<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-342\" src=\"http:\/\/estudiopatagon.com\/themes\/wordpress\/recov3\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/architecture-1087821_1280-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"718\" height=\"404\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of a project&#8217;s construction, architects will often direct contractors to provide material mockups for review. These allow the design team to review material and color selections, and make modifications before product orders are placed.<\/p>\n<p>Architectural mockups can also be used for performance testing (such as water penetration at window installations, for example) and help inform the subcontractors how details are to be installed.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation,&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":340,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/339"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=339"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/339\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/340"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=339"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=339"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=339"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
