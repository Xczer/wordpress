The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a &#8220;powerful dog breed&#8221;.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The term may derive from Proto-Germanic *dukk\u014dn, represented in Old English finger-docce (&#8220;finger-muscle&#8221;) or (as suggested by Piotr G\u0105siorowski) the Old English colour adjective dox, meaning &#8220;brown&#8221; or &#8220;tan&#8221;.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In either case, the word seems to have been derived via the diminutive suffix -ga also seen in frogga &#8220;frog&#8221;, picga &#8220;pig&#8221;, stagga &#8220;stag&#8221;, wicga &#8220;beetle, worm&#8221;, among others.<\/p>\n<h2>Terminology<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The term dog typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.<\/li>\n<li><del>An adult female is a bitch.<\/del><\/li>\n<li>An adult male capable of reproduction is a stud.<\/li>\n<li>An adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch, or brood mother.<\/li>\n<li><em>Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are pups or puppies.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>A group of pups from the same gestation period is a litter.<\/li>\n<li>The father of a litter is a sire.
