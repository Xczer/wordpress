										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a prototype if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.</p>
<p>Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. Mock-ups address the idea captured in a popular engineering one-liner: You can fix it now on the drafting board with an eraser or you can fix it later on the construction site with a sledge hammer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Consumer goods</li>
<li>Furniture and cabinetry</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p><em>Mockups are used as design tools virtually everywhere a new product is designed.</em></p>
<p>Mockups are used in the automotive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">device industry</a> as part of the product development process, where dimensions, overall impression, and shapes are tested in a wind tunnel experiment. They can also be used to test consumer reaction.</p>
<h2>Consumer goods</h2>
<p>Mockups are used in the consumer goods industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, <strong>human factors</strong>, overall impression, and commercial art are tested in marketing research.</p>
<h2>Furniture and cabinetry</h2>
<p>Mockups are commonly required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry.</p>
<p>The intention is often to produce a full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine the proportions of the piece, relating to various dimensions of the piece itself, or to fit the piece into a specific space or room.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ability to see how the design of the piece relates to the rest of the space is also an important factor in determining size and design.</p></blockquote>
<p>When designing a functional piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, mockups can be used to test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use.</p>
<p>Mockups can also be used to test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. Mockups used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-342" src="http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/recov3/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/architecture-1087821_1280-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="404" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of a project&#8217;s construction, architects will often direct contractors to provide material mockups for review. These allow the design team to review material and color selections, and make modifications before product orders are placed.</p>
<p>Architectural mockups can also be used for performance testing (such as water penetration at window installations, for example) and help inform the subcontractors how details are to be installed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The iPhone line of products use Apple&#8217;s iOS mobile operating system software.</p>
<p>The first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.</p>
<blockquote><p>The user interface is built around the device&#8217;s multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks.</p></blockquote>
<p>An iPhone can shoot video (though this was not a standard feature until the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone</a> 3GS), take photos, play music, send and receive email, browse the web, send and receive text messages, follow GPS navigation, record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive visual voicemail.</p>
<p><code>Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading mobile apps.</code></p>
<p>As of January 2017, Apple&#8217;s App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.</p>

<h2>History and availability</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-364" src="http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/recov3/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mobile-phone-1875813_1280-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="478" /></p>
<p>Development of what was to become the iPhone began in 2004, <strong>when Apple started to gather a team of 1,000 employees</strong> (including Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac and iPod) to work on the highly confidential &#8220;Project Purple&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet (which Apple eventually revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular Wireless (which became AT&amp;T Mobility) at the time—at an estimated development cost of US$150 million over thirty months</p>
<h2><span id="Sales_and_profits" class="mw-headline">Sales and profits</span></h2>
<p>Apple sold 6.1 million first generation iPhone units over five quarters.</p>
<p>Sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 temporarily surpassed those of <strong>Research In Motion&#8217;s (RIM) BlackBerry</strong> sales of 5.2 million units, which briefly made Apple the third largest mobile phone manufacturer by revenue, after Nokia and Samsung (however, some of this income is deferred.</p>
<p><em>Recorded sales grew steadily thereafter, and by the end of fiscal year 2010, a total of 73.5 million iPhones had been sold.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.</p>
<p>The genus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coffea</a> is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Coffee plants are now cultivated in <strong>over 70 countries</strong>, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta.</p>
<p><code>Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.</code></p>
<p>Dried coffee seeds (referred to as &#8220;beans&#8221;) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-370" src="http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/recov3/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/desktop-2325627_1280-1024x614.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="431" /></p>
<p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[medical citation needed] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, café latte).</p>
<blockquote><p>It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clinical studies indicate that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate coffee consumption</a> is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those long-term studies are of generally poor quality.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word &#8220;coffee&#8221; entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve, borrowed in turn from the Arabic qahwah.</p>
<p>The Arabic word qahwah was traditionally held to refer to a type of wine whose etymology is given by Arab lexicographers as deriving from the verb qahiya (قَهِيَ), &#8220;to lack hunger&#8221;, in reference to the drink&#8217;s reputation as an appetite suppressant.</p>
<p>It has also been proposed that the source may be the Proto-Central Semitic root q-h-h meaning &#8220;dark&#8221;</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Legendary accounts</h3>
<p>According to legend, ancestors of today&#8217;s <strong>Oromo</strong> people in a region of <strong>Kaffa in Ethiopia</strong> were believed to have been the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant, though no direct evidence has been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the native populations might have used it as a stimulant or even known about it, earlier than the 17th century.</p>
<p>The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee when he noticed how excited his goats</a> became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.</p>
<h3>Historical transmission</h3>
<p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Accounts differ on the origin of coffee (seeds) prior to its appearance in Yemen. One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa&#8217;d for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An identity document (also called a piece of identification or ID, or colloquially as papers) is any document which may be used to prove a person&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p><strong>If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, Citizen Card), or Passport Card.</strong></p>
<p>Some countries issue formal identity documents, as national identification cards which may be compulsory or non-compulsory, while others may require identity verification using regional identification or informal documents.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the identity document incorporates a person&#8217;s photograph, it may be called photo ID.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the absence of a formal identity document, a driver&#8217;s license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification.</p>
<p><del>Some countries do not accept driver&#8217;s licenses for identification</del>, often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification.</p>
<p><code>Some countries require all people to have an identity document available at any time.</code></p>
<p>Many countries require all foreigners to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document">passport</a> or occasionally a national identity card from their country available at any time if they do not have a residence permit in the country.</p>
<h3>Contents</h3>
<ul>

<li>Adoption</li>
<li>National policies</li>
</ul>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A version of the passport considered to be the earliest identity document inscribed into law was introduced by King Henry V of England with the Safe Conducts Act 1414.</p>
<p><em>For the next 500 years and before World War I, most people did not have or need an identity document.</em></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-374" src="http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/recov3/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/passport-2642170_1280-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="478" /></p>
<p>Photographic identification appeared in 1876 but it did not become widely used until the early 20th century when photographs became part of passports and other ID documents such as driver&#8217;s licenses, all of which came to be referred to as &#8220;photo IDs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Both Australia and Great Britain, for example, introduced the requirement for a photographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document">passport</a> in 1915 after the so-called Lody spy scandal.</p>
<h2>Adoption</h2>
<p>Law enforcement <strong>officials claim that identity cards make</strong> surveillance and the search for criminals easier and consequently support the universal adoption of identity cards.</p>
<p>In countries that don&#8217;t have a national identity card, there is, however, concern about the projected large costs and potential abuse of high-tech smartcards.</p>
<hr />
<p>In many countries &#8211; and especially English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States &#8211; there are no government-issued compulsory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document">identity cards</a> to all citizens.</p>
<p>Ireland has the Public services card although it is a not considered as a national identity card by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP).</p>
